A former Pennsylvania Catholic school teacher claims she was fired from her job last week after her employer found out she was pregnant and had no plans to marry her boyfriend. Naiad Reich told ABC affiliate WNEP 16 that the principal of Coal Township’s Our Lady of Lourdes Regional School told her Friday that she was being let go for violating the school’s morality code.
“I feel like I’m a rewriting of ‘The Scarlet Letter’ at this point, just minus the affair,” the 31-year-old said about her termination, according to The Associated Press. Reich had taught high school English and creative writing at the school, and also served as yearbook adviser, Penn Live reports. On Wednesday, she was still listed on the school’s website as a high school teacher.  The teacher is expecting a child with her boyfriend of four years next June, Penn Live reports. Reich said when she told the school’s principal about the pregnancy, it was apparent that the principal was “not happy with the circumstances.”  “If there’s no eventual plan in the near future to get married, it was either that or I had to be let go,” Reich told WNEP 16.
